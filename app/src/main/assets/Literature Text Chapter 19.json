He tried to flee from detention after being handed to the South African authorities by the Mozambiquan authorities and was shot in the back at close range. On partial healing, he was sent to the notorious Robben Island where he was kept in the cell next to Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s. According to the apartheid code, he was considered a coloured person.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Dennis Vincent Brutus was a South African activist, educator, journalist and poet best known for his campaign to have apartheid South Africa banned from the Olympic Games. He lived between 28th November 1924 and 26th December 2009. He was born in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and had ancestry of mixed French, Italian and South African.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">His activist life likens him to a crusader for his country. A knight on duty for a mistress; and this has so often appeared in his poetry. He loved South Africa deeply and did everything to win its freedom. In his poem<\/span><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">,<\/span><\/em><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/em><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&ldquo;It Is the Constant Image of Your Face&rdquo;,<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;he closes the first stanza by saying<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&ldquo;my land takes precedence of all my loves&rdquo;<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">. This was his passion. While he was in prison, news broke that South Africa had been banned from the 1964 Tokyo Olympics as he had campaigned for.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><br><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">A TROUBADOUR I TRAVERSE&hellip;<\/span><\/strong><br><br><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">A troubadour, I traverse all my land<\/span><\/em><br><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">exploring all her wide flung parts with zest<\/span><\/em><br><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">probing in motion sweeter far than rest<\/span><\/em><br><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">her secret thickets with an amorous hand:<\/span><\/em><br><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">5 and I have laughed disdaining those who banned<\/span><\/em><br><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">enquiry and movement, delighting in the test<\/span><\/em><br><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">of wills when doomed by Saracened arrest,<\/span><\/em><br><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">choosing, like unarmed thumb, simply to stand.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Thus, quixoting till a cast-off of my land<\/span><\/em><br><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">10 I sing and fare, person to loved-one pressed<\/span><\/em><br><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">braced for this pressure and the captor&rsquo;s hand<\/span><\/em><br><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">that snaps off service like a weathered strand:<\/span><\/em><br><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&ndash; no mistress-favor has adorned my breast<\/span><\/em><br><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">only the shadow of an arrow-brand.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><br><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">REVIEW<\/span><\/strong><br><br><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&ldquo;A troubadour I traverse&hellip;&rdquo;<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">is a poem written on chivalrous themes. It is a Petrarchan (Italian) sonnet, made of a full octave (rhyming abbaabba) and a sestet (rhyming abaaba). First off, a troubadour is a medieval European poet-knight whose duty it was to ride alongside and defend a mistress. Until the troubadour retires from service, his duty is to die defending her. And he often praised her high unattainable love in his lyrics.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">But Brutus is a troubadour for his homeland, seeing South Africa as a mistress for whom he must live and die. In the title and first four lines, Brutus talks about his romantic traverse (or travel &ndash; line 1) across the land, exploring its wide-flung, spread-out or exposed parts in a movement that is sweeter than any other that he knows. He does so with zeal and with his &ldquo;amorous hand&rdquo; (line 4). And in this ecstasy, he has laughed at all those who have sought to stop or question him even though he knew that a crusade in the name of love for South Africa under apartheid meant that he will die protecting her or be doomed to Saracened arrest (line 7). Saracens were Muslim Arabs against whom Christian knights fought the wars of the Crusade. Significantly, South African police armoured cars were also called Saracens. And in the face of this threat of arrest, he chose only &ldquo;simply to stand&rdquo; (line8) unarmed.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">So, he continues the protest, enjoying the romance with his land while tempting the apartheid regime for an arrest, quixoting till he is cast-off from his land (infer line 9). Don Quixote was the protagonist of the Spanish novelist Cervantes&rsquo; book and he spent his life fighting imaginary monsters and enemies, earning him a laughable reputation. So Brutus makes himself a quixotic fool for his homeland by a love that presses him (line 10) and which makes him prepare for an imminent arrest (captor&rsquo;s hand &ndash; line 11) till he is snapped off service (line 12 &ndash; killed for his mistress South Africa or made incapable by detention). No mistress-favour or emblem of service adorns his breast as is usual for a troubadour but only the shadow of an arrow-brand (lines 13 and 14). The arrow-brand is the standard British symbol for a convict and Brutus&rsquo; reference to an arrow-brand could be the scar he keeps on his back from a gunshot for trying to flee from detention.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">It is amazing how romance, the story of a man&rsquo;s life and apartheid themes can be merged into this one poem of fourteen lines. Brutus is an African hero for giving us a chronicle of the fight against apartheid through the eyes of an African poet.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">UNN PUTME Examples<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Questions below are based on Brutu&#39;s poem &quot;A Troubadour I Traverse&quot;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">1.
