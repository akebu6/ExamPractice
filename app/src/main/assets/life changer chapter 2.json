  "text": "Twenty years ago, Ummi gains admission into the university and gets married to her husband even before she starts her registration. Ummi tells them about the freedom and the carefree life of students in the university, the difficulty in distinguishing between teachers and students with females dressing almost naked, and how some faculties are required to be on dress codes. Ummi further discloses her experience with Salma, a sophisticated young lady.\n\nSalma goes for her registration much later than everyone else but expresses discomfort and irritation about the delay in the registration process. Salma is interrogated by a young man on the queue and he continuously engages her in a discussion but Salma continues to criticize and overgeneralize her opinions about lecturers. Salma does not only create a similarity between lectures and policemen as personalities that can be bribed, she also boasts about her ability to win the lecturer’s favour if she gives him as low as two or three thousand naira. Unknowingly to Salma and to the astonishment of everyone on the queue, the young man she has been conversing with is the lecturer in charge of the registration procedure.\n\nUmmi proceeds to her departmental registration and she is directed to the HOD’s office. The HOD is seen exchanging endearing pleasantries with Ummi which she finds rather discomforting and inappropriate. Ummi assumes the HOD is trying to make a pass at her. She indeterminately manages to accommodate this until she is given her matriculation number and leaves the office irritated and angry. On getting home, Ummi tells her husband about her experience at the HOD’s office but she is astounded to learn about the friendship and rapport between her husband and Dr Sam John."
