His father was a stonemason and his mother educated Hardy until age eight. His family was too poor to pay for university, so Hardy became an architect&#39;s apprentice until he decided to focus on writing. His stories are generally set in the Dorset area. In 1874 he married Emma Gifford, and her death in 1912 had a profound effect on him. In 1914 he married his secretary, Florence Dugdale. Hardy&#39;s first few novels were unsuccessful, and even his later works were controversial and often censored.<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Tess of the d&#39;Urbervilles<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">and<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><strong><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Jude the Obscure<\/span><\/em><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">drew such an outcry for their sexual frankness and social criticism that Hardy stopped writing fiction, focusing instead on his poetry.

Tess is a beautiful, loyal young woman living with her impoverished family in the village of Marlott. Tess has a keen sense of responsibility and is committed to doing the best she can for her family, although her inexperience and lack of wise parenting leave her extremely vulnerable. Her life is complicated when her father discovers a link to the noble line of the d&rsquo;Urbervilles, and, as a result, Tess is sent to work at the d&rsquo;Urberville mansion. Unfortunately, her ideals cannot prevent her from sliding further and further into misfortune after she becomes pregnant by Alec d&rsquo;Urberville. The terrible irony is that Tess and her family are not really related to this branch of the d&rsquo;Urbervilles at all: Alec&rsquo;s father, a merchant named Simon Stokes, simply assumed the name after he retired.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <ul style=\"margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n      <li style=\"margin-left:27.6pt; margin-bottom:8pt; padding-left:8.4pt; font-family:serif; font-size:10pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt;\">Angel Clare<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\r\n  <\/ul>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">An intelligent young man who has decided to become a farmer to preserve his intellectual freedom from the pressures of city life.

margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Thomas Hardy&#39;s Tess of the d&#39;Urbervilles begins with the chance meeting between<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Parson Tringham<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">and<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">John Durbeyfield. The parson addresses the impoverished Durbeyfield as &quot;Sir John,&quot; and remarks that he has just learned that the Durbeyfields are descended from the d&#39;Urbervilles, a family once renowned in England. Although Parson Tringham mentions this only to note how the mighty have fallen, John Durbeyfield rejoices over the news. Durbeyfield arrives at home during the May Day dance, in which his daughter Tess dances. During this celebration, Tess happens to meet three brothers: Felix, Cuthbert and<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Angel Clare. Angel does not dance with Tess, but takes note of her as the most striking of the girls. When Tess arrives at home, she learns that her father is at the tavern celebrating the news of his esteemed family connections. Since John must awake early to deliver bees, Tess sends her mother to get her father, then her brother Abraham, and finally goes to the tavern herself when none of them return.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">At the tavern, John Durbeyfield reveals that he has a grand plan to send his daughter to claim kinship with the remaining d&#39;Urbervilles, and thus make her eligible to marry a gentleman. The next morning, John Durbeyfield is too ill to undertake his journey, thus Tess and Abraham deliver the bees. During their travels, the carriage wrecks and their horse is killed. Since the family has no source of income without their horse, Tess agrees to go to the home of the Stoke-d&#39;Urbervilles to claim kinship. There she meets Alec d&#39;Urberville, who shows her the estate and prepares to kiss her. Tess returns home and later receives a letter from Mrs. Stoke-d&#39;Urberville, who offers Tess employment tending to her chickens. When Alec comes to take Tess to the d&#39;Urberville estate, Joan thinks that he may marry Tess. On the way to the d&#39;Urberville estate at Trantridge, Alec drives the carriage recklessly and tells Tess to grasp him around the waist. He persists, and when Tess refuses him, she calls her an artful hussy and rather sensitive for a cottage girl.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">When Tess meets Mrs. Stoke-d&#39;Urberville, she learns that the blind woman has no knowledge that Tess is a relative. Tess becomes more accustomed to Alec, despite his continual propositions to her. She finds Alec hiding behind the curtains while Tess whistles to the bullfinches in his mother&#39;s bedroom.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">During a weekend visit to Chaseborough, Tess travels with several other girls. Among these girls are Car and<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Nancy Darch, nicknamed the Queen of Spades and the Queen of Diamonds. Car carries a wicker basket with groceries on her head, and finds that a stream of treacle drips from this basket down her back. While all of the girls laugh at Car, she only notices that Tess is laughing and confronts her. Car appears ready to fight Tess when Alec d&#39;Urberville arrives and takes her away. As Alec whisks Tess off, Car&#39;s mother remarks that Tess has &quot;gotten out of the frying pan and into the fire.&quot;<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">On the journey home, Alec asks Tess why she dislikes when he kisses her, and she replies that she does not love him and in fact is sometimes angered by him. When Tess learns that Alec has prolonged the ride home, she decides to walk home herself. Alec asks her to wait while he ascertains their precise location, and returns to find Tess, who has fallen asleep. Alec has sex with Tess.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Several weeks later, Tess returns home. Tess tells Alec that she hates herself for her weakness and will never love him. While at home, Tess admits to her mother what happened and asks her why she did not warn Tess about the danger that men pose. Rumors abound concerning Tess&#39;s return to the village of Marlott. In fact, Tess is pregnant and has bears the child months later. However, the child becomes gravely ill before she has had it baptized. Without the opportunity to call a minister, Tess baptizes the baby herself with the name Sorrow before it dies. When Tess meets the parson the next day, he agrees that the baby had been properly baptized, but refuses to give Sorrow a Christian burial until she convinces him otherwise.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Tess leaves Marlott once again to work at Talbothays dairy, where she works for<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Richard Crick<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">and finds that Angel Clare, whom she vaguely remembers, now works at the dairy. The other milkmaids (Izz Huett,<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Retty Priddle,<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Marian) tell Tess that Angel is there to learn milking and that, since he is a parson&#39;s son, rarely notices the girls. Although his brothers are each clergyman and he was expected to be as well, Angel did not attend college because of philosophical and religious differences with his father and established church doctrine. He works at Talbothays to study the workings of a dairy in preparation for owning a farm himself one day.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Angel grows fond of Tess, and begins arranging the cows so that she may milk the ones that are her favorites. However, Tess learns from Dairyman Crick that Angel has scorn for members of noble families, even those whose families have fallen from prominence. Tess realizes that the three other milkmaids are attracted to Tess, but they know that Angel prefers Tess. When Tess overhears the three milkmaids discussing this, she feels jealousy at the others&#39; attraction for Angel, and begins to believe that, as a working woman, she is more suited to be a farmer&#39;s wife than a woman of equal rank as Angel. Still, Tess retreats from Angel&#39;s affections until he finally declares his love for her.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Angel visits his home in Emminster, where he discusses the possibility of marriage with his parents. While visiting his family, Angel realizes how life at Talbothays had changed him. Although his parents suggest that Angel marry a local girl,<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Mercy Chant, Angel suggests that he should marry a woman with practical talents. His parents only consent when they feel certain that the woman is an unimpeachable Christian. When Angel returns from Emminster, he proposes to Tess, who rejects him without giving him a reason. Although he persists, she finally admits that she is a d&#39;Urberville, thus a member of the type of family that he despises. When Angel remains unfazed by this news, she agrees to marry him.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Tess writes to her mother to ask whether she should admit the entirety of her past to Angel, but her mother assures her that she should not. Tess remains nervous concerning her impending marriage, attempting to postpone the date and forgetting to make important wedding plans. While in town with Angel, Tess sees a man who recognizes her from Trantridge and remarks on her questionable reputation. Angel defends her honor, but Tess realizes that she must tell him about her past with Alec d&#39;Urberville. Tess writes Angel a letter and slips it under his doorway. The next morning Angel behaves normally. It is only on the day of her wedding that Tess finds that the letter slid under the carpet and Angel thus never found it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">After Angel and Tess marry, they go to Wellbridge for their honeymoon and remain at a home once owned by the d&#39;Urbervilles. Tess learns from<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Jonathan Kail, who delivers a wedding gift from the Cricks, that the girls at Talbothays have suffered greatly since Angel and Tess left. On their wedding night, Angel and Tess vow to tell one another their faults. Angel admits that he had a short affair with a stranger in London, while Tess admits about Alec d&#39;Urberville.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">After telling Angel her story, Tess begs for forgiveness, but he claims that forgiveness is irrelevant, for she was one person and is now another woman in the same shape. She vows to do anything he asks and to die if he would so desire, but he claims that there is discordance between her current self-sacrifice and past self-preservation. Although he claims to forgive her, Angel still questions whether or not he still loves her. Angel&#39;s obstinate nature blocks his acceptance of Tess&#39;s faults on principle, and he remains with Tess only to avoid scandal until he tells her that they should separate.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">That night, Angel begins sleepwalking and carries Tess out of their home and across the nearby river to the local cemetery, where he places her in a coffin. She leads him back to bed without waking him, and the next morning he seems to remember nothing of the event. Angel tells Tess that he will go away from her and she should not come to him, but may write if she is ill or needs anything.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Tess returns home, where her family remains impoverished and Tess has no place to stay. When Tess receives a letter from Angel telling her that he has gone to the north of England to look for a farm, Tess uses this as an excuse to leave Marlott. Angel visits his parents and tells them nothing about his separation, but they sense that some difficulty has occurred in his marriage. Angel decides to go to Brazil to look for a farm, although he realizes that he has treated Tess poorly. Before leaving for Brazil, Angel sees Izz Huett and proposes that she accompany him to Brazil. When he asks her whether she loves him as much as Tess does, Izz replies that nobody could love him more than Tess does, because Tess would give up her life for Angel. Angel realizes his foolishness and tells Izz that her answer saved him from great folly.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Tess journeys to Flintcomb-Ash, where she will join Marian at a different farm. On her way to the farm, Tess finds the man from Trantridge who identified her when she was with Angel, and he demands an apology for allowing Angel to wrongfully defend her honor. Tess hides from him, and after she is propositioned by young men in a nearby inn the next morning, she clips off her eyebrows to make herself less unattractive.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Tess works as a swede-hacker at Flintcomb-Ash, a barren and rough place. Marian believes that Tess has been abused and thinks Angel may be to blame, but Tess refuses to allow Marian to mention Angel&#39;s name in such a derogatory manner. Izz Huett and Retty Priddle join Marian and Tess at Flintcomb-Ash, and Tess learns that the man who insulted her is the owner of the farm where she works. Car and Nancy Darch work at this farm as well, although neither recognize Tess. Since the conditions at Flintcomb-Ash are so arduous, Tess visits Emminster to ask the Clares for assistance, but does not approach them when she overhears Felix and<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Cuthbert Clare<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">discussing how disreputable Angel&#39;s new wife must be. While returning to Flintcomb-Ash, Tess learns that a noted preacher is nearby: Alec d&#39;Urberville.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">When Tess confronts Alec, he claims that he has a newfound duty to save others and feels that he must save Tess. Still, he seems to blame Tess for her tempting Alec to sin, and makes her swear never to tempt him again. Alec begins to visit Tess frequently, despite her overt suspicion and dislike for him, and even asks her to marry him and accompany him to Africa where he plans to be a missionary. Tess refuses and admits to Alec that she is already married, but Alec derides the idea that her marriage is secure and attempts to refute Tess&#39;s (and Angel&#39;s) religious views. Alec accuses Tess once more of tempting him, and blames her for his backsliding from Christianity. Alec soon disavows his faith and loses the adornments of it, returning to his more fashionable ways and giving up preaching. When Alec tells Tess that she should leave her husband, she slaps him and then refuses to back down when Alec appears ready to return her blow. She tells Alec that she will not cry if he hits her, because she will always be his victim.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Alec soon tries a different tactic to get Tess to submit to him; he attempts to dominate her by exerting financial superiority. Alec offers to support her family, but only as a means to make Tess and her family dependent. Tess returns home to Marlott when she learns that her mother may be dying and her father is quite ill, but soon after her return her father dies instead, while her mother recovers. After the death of John Durbeyfield, the family loses their home and must find accommodations elsewhere. They move to Kingsbere, where the d&#39;Urberville family tomb is located. Although Alec offers to support the Durbeyfields, Tess refuses, even when he offers a guarantee in writing that he would continue to support them no matter the relationship between Tess and himself. When the Durbeyfields reach Kingsbere, they find no room at the inn where they were scheduled to stay, and thus must remain in the church near the d&#39;Urberville family vault.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Angel Clare returns home from Brazil, weak and sickly, and finds the letter from Tess in which she claims that she will try to forget him. Angel writes to her home at Marlott to search for her, but only later finds out that the Durbeyfields are no longer at Marlott and that Joan does not know where her daughter is. Angel decides to search for Tess, and eventually finds her mother, who reluctantly admits to Angel that Tess is at Sandbourne, a thriving village nearby.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Angel finds Tess at an inn at Sandbourne, where she has been living a comfortable life with Alec d&#39;Urberville. Tess tells Angel that it is too late, and that Alec convinced her that he would never return. Tess admits that she hates Alec now, for he lied to her about Angel. After Angel leaves, Tess returns to her room and begins to sob. Alec finds her, and after a heated argument Tess stabs Alec in the heart, killing him.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">As the dejected Angel leaves town, he finds Tess following him. She admits that she has killed Alec, and the two continue along together to escape. They remain at a deserted mansion before continuing northward to find a boat out of England. They rest at Stonehenge; there Tess, who realizes that she will inevitably be captured, asks Angel to marry her sister, Liza-Lu, after she is gone. As Tess sleeps a party of men surround Angel and Tess to capture her and arrest her for Alec&#39;s murder. Tess is executed for her crime, while Angel does her bidding and presumably marries Liza-Lu.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Themes in Tess of the d&#39;Urbervilles<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Injustice and Fate<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">The cruel hand of fate hangs over all the characters and actions of the novel, as Tess Durbeyfield&#39;s story is basically defined by the bad things that happen to her. Thomas Hardy himself, as the author of the novel, obviously causes the many unfair coincidences and plot twists that beset Tess, but as narrator he also manages to appear as her only advocate against an unjust world. Tess&#39;s hardships are described as mere sport.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Nature and Modernity<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Tess of the d&#39;Urbervilles is set in both a time and place of societal transition from the agricultural to the industrial. The rural English towns and farm women often represent Hardy&#39;s idea of Nature, while machines and upper-class men are associated with the modernizing forces of industrialization. Many of the descriptions and situations of the novel focus on the way that the characters and society are being separated from a more ancient lifestyle.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Social Criticism<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">As in many of his other works, Thomas Hardy used Tess of the d&#39;Urbervilles as a vessel for his criticisms of English Victorian society of the late 19th century. The novel&#39;s largest critique is aimed at the sexual double standard, with all the extremities and misfortunes of Tess&#39;s life highlighting the unfairness of her treatment. Society condemns her as an unclean woman because she was raped, while Angel&#39;s premarital affair is barely mentioned&hellip;<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Paganism and Christianity<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Thomas Hardy struggled with his own religious beliefs, and that struggle comes through in his work. He idealized the paganism of the past but was also attached to his family&#39;s Christianity, and generally he accepted some sort of supernatural being that controlled fate. Tess herself is usually portrayed as an embodiment of that pagan innocence, a sort of English Nature goddess. She first appears performing the fertility ritual of May-Day, then bedecked in flowers from&hellip;<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Women<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Hardy muses a lot about Tess&#39;s status as a woman and the various roles women assume in society. Tess often plays the part of a passive victim, falling asleep and inadvertently killing Prince, falling asleep before her rape, and falling asleep at Stonehenge where she is arrested. She and many of the other female characters also act as symbols of fertility, nature, and purity. They are linked with the lushness of Talbothays and&hellip;<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Motifs<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Motifs are recurring structures, contrasts, or literary devices that can help to develop and inform the text&rsquo;s major themes.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Birds<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Images of birds recur throughout the novel, evoking or contradicting their traditional spiritual association with a higher realm of transcendence. Both the Christian dove of peace and the Romantic songbirds of Keats and Shelley, which symbolize sublime heights, lead us to expect that birds will have positive meaning in this novel. Tess occasionally hears birdcalls on her frequent hikes across the countryside; their free expressiveness stands in stark contrast to Tess&rsquo;s silent and constrained existence as a wronged and disgraced girl. When Tess goes to work for Mrs. d&rsquo;Urberville, she is surprised to find that the old woman&rsquo;s pet finches are frequently released to fly free throughout the room. These birds offer images of hope and liberation. Yet there is irony attached to birds as well, making us doubt whether these images of hope and freedom are illusory. Mrs. d&rsquo;Urberville&rsquo;s birds leave little white spots on the upholstery, which presumably some servant&mdash;perhaps Tess herself&mdash;will have to clean. It may be that freedom for one creature entails hardship for another, just as Alec&rsquo;s free enjoyment of Tess&rsquo;s body leads her to a lifetime of suffering. In the end, when Tess encounters the pheasants maimed by hunters and lying in agony, birds no longer seem free, but rather oppressed and submissive. These pheasants are no Romantic songbirds hovering far above the Earth&mdash;they are victims of earthly violence, condemned to suffer down below and never fly again.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">The Book of Genesis<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">The Genesis story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden is evoked repeatedly throughout<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Tess of the d&rsquo;Urbervilles,<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">giving the novel a broader metaphysical and philosophical dimension. The roles of Eve and the serpent in paradise are clearly delineated: Angel is the noble Adam newly born, while Tess is the indecisive and troubled Eve. When Tess gazes upon Angel in Chapter XXVII, &ldquo;she regarded him as Eve at her second waking might have regarded Adam.&rdquo; Alec, with his open avowal that he is bad to the bone, is the conniving Satan. He seduces Tess under a tree, giving her sexual knowledge in return for her lost innocence. The very name of the forest where this seduction occurs, the Chase, suggests how Eve will be chased from Eden for her sins. This guilt, which will never be erased, is known in Christian theology as the original sin that all humans have inherited. Just as John Durbeyfield is told in Chapter I that &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t live anywhere,&rdquo; and his family is evicted after his death at the end of the novel, their homelessness evokes the human exile from Eden. Original sin suggests that humans have fallen from their once great status to a lower station in life, just as the d&rsquo;Urbervilles have devolved into the modern Durbeyfields. This Story of the Fall&mdash;or of the &ldquo;Pure Drop,&rdquo; to recall the name of a pub in Tess&rsquo;s home village&mdash;is much more than a social fall. It is an explanation of how all of us humans&mdash;not only Tess&mdash;never quite seem to live up to our expectations, and are never able to inhabit the places of grandeur we feel we deserve.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Variant Names<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">The transformation of the d&rsquo;Urbervilles into the Durbeyfields is one example of the common phenomenon of renaming, or variant naming, in the novel. Names matter in this novel. Tess knows and accepts that she is a lowly Durbeyfield, but part of her still believes, as her parents also believe, that her aristocratic original name should be restored. John Durbeyfield goes a step further than Tess, and actually renames himself Sir John, as his tombstone epitaph shows. Another character who renames himself is Simon Stokes, Alec&rsquo;s father, who purchased a family tree and made himself Simon Stoke-d&rsquo;Urberville. The question raised by all these cases of name changing, whether successful or merely imagined, is the extent to which an altered name brings with it an altered identity. Alec acts notoriously ungentlemanly throughout the novel, but by the end, when he appears at the d&rsquo;Urberville family vault, his lordly and commanding bearing make him seem almost deserving of the name his father has bought, like a spoiled medieval nobleman. Hardy&rsquo;s interest in name changes makes reality itself seem changeable according to whims of human perspective. The village of Blakemore, as we are reminded twice in Chapters I and II, is also known as Blackmoor, and indeed Hardy famously renames the southern English countryside as &ldquo;Wessex.&rdquo; He imposes a fictional map on a real place, with names altered correspondingly. Reality may not be as solid as the names people confer upon it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">UNN PUTME Examples<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Questions below are based on Thomas Hardy&#39;s &quot;Tess of the D&#39;Urbervilles&quot;<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">1.
