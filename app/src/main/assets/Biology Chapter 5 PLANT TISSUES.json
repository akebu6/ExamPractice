Different types of plant cells include parenchymal, collenchymal, and sclerenchymal cells. The three types differ in structure and function.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">1. Parenchyma:<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;A Parenchyma cells may be modified and more specialized in certain parts of the plant. An example of a tissue that can be regarded as a modified parenchyma is the mesophyll. The mesophyll is the packing tissue found between the two epidermal layers of leaves. And consist of parenchyma modified to carry out photosynthesis. In dicots, there are two distinct layers of mesophyll: palisade mesophyll and spongy.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">The palisade parenchyma is found in the leaf Parenchyma cells may be modified and more specialized in certain parts of the plant. An example of a tissue that can be regarded as a modified parenchyma is the mesophyll. The mesophyll is the packing tissue found between the two epidermal layers of leaves. And consist of parenchyma modified to carry out photosynthesis. In dicots, there are two distinct layers of mesophyll: palisade mesophilic and spongy.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">2. Collenchyma:&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Collenchyma tissues are the special type of cells. The walls of the cells become thicker with the compilation of cellulose and pectin. Their walls are irregularly thickened with some corners. The cells are elongated, living and are filled with protoplasm.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">3.<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Sclerenchyma:&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">The cells of this tissue are hard, much elongated with thick walls. The tissue composed of cells with the thickening of walls with lignin for providing mechanical support is called sclerenchyma. Though, in early stage of their development, the sclerenchyma cells are alive, soon they become dead losing the living protoplasm when they get mature. There are two types of sclerenchyma, the fibers and sclerides.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">The three types of plant cells are found in each of the major types of plant tissues: dermal, ground, and vascular tissues. Dermal tissue covers the outside of a plant in a single layer of cells called the epidermis. It mediates most of the interactions between a plant and its environment.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Ground tissue makes up most of the interior of a plant. It carries out basic metabolic functions and stores food and water. Vascular tissue runs through the ground tissue inside a plant. It consists of bundles of xylem and phloem, which transport fluids throughout the plant.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Xylem<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;is one of the two types of transport tissue in vascular plants, phloem being the other (complex tissues). The basic function of xylem is to transport water from roots to stems and leaves, but it also transports nutrients.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">NB:&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">The xylem is more deeply located than the phloem. The major difference between monocot and dicot stem is in the vascular bundle. On the other hand, in dicots stem, the vascular bundles have a definite shape arranged in the form of one or two broken rings. In dicot stem bundle sheath is absent, while in monocot stem the bundle sheath is present.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Phloem<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;is the living tissue in vascular plants that transports the soluble organic compounds made during photosynthesis and known as photosynthates, the sugar sucrose, to parts of the plant where they are needed. This transport process is called translocation.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Sieve tubes<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;in the phloem of angiosperms are flanked by one or several plasma-rich, nucleated companion cells, that do not occur in gymnosperms. Much less is known about the phylogeny of sieve elements than about that of xylem members.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Most plants continue to grow as long as they live. They grow through a combination of cell growth and cell division (mitosis). The key to plant growth is meristem, a type of plant tissue consisting of undifferentiated cells that can continue to divide and differentiate. Meristem allows plant stems and roots to grow longer (primary growth) and wider (secondary growth).<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">A meristem is the tissue in most plants containing undifferentiated cells, found in zones of the plant where growth can take place. Meristematic cells give rise to various organs of a plant and are responsible for growth.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Cambium<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;is found only in Dicot stem, it&rsquo;s a single layer of activity dividing cell. It forms the xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside. It&rsquo;s not a supporting system. The important supporting tissues in plants are: the turgid parenchyma, sclerenchyma, collenchyma and xylem. Cork cambium (pl. cambia or cambiums) is a tissue found in many vascular plants as a part of the epidermis. It is one of the many layers of bark, between the cork and primary phloem. The cork cambium is a lateral meristem and is responsible for secondary growth that replaces the epidermis in roots and stems.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">The main job of the cambium is to promote growth of secondary xylem and phloem. It&#39;s located directly between the primary xylem and phloem in a circular layer. Typically, dicot plants or gymnosperms have cambium tissue. A dicot is a plant that has two embryonic leaves at germination.<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">UNN PUTME Examples<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n  <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">1.
