He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee. He began to be sorrowful and troubled that he said to them. &ldquo;My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.&rsquo;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Going a little further he fell on his face and prayed, &ldquo;My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.&rdquo; When he came to the disciples, he found them sleeping and asked them to watch with him for one hour and pray that they might not enter into temptation for the spirit was willing but the flesh was weak.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">For the second time, he went out and prayed saying, &ldquo;Father, if this cannot pass unless drink it, thy will be done&rdquo; When he came back, he still found the disciples sleeping and their eyes were heavy with sleep. He left them for the third time praying in the same way.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">On coming back, he announced to them that the hour for the son of man to be betrayed into the. hands of sinners had come. While he was still speaking, Judas one of the twelve came in the company of a great crowd, carrying swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Judas who had earlier arranged with them to identify Jesus through a kiss walked up to Jesus saying, &ldquo;Hail, Master!&rdquo; He kissed him but Jesus said &ldquo;friend, why are you here?&rdquo; The crowd came forward and seized Jesus, prompting one of his disciples to draw his sword and cut the era of the slave of the high priest. Jesus however cautioned him to sheath his sword.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Luke noted that Jesus restored the ear and called on those who attempted to defend him especially his disciples to allow the scripture to be fulfilled.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">At once the disciples fled except Peter who followed at a distance to the house of the high priest, where he sat inside with the guards to see the end. They sought false allegation against Jesus to kill him, but when they could not find any, they instigated two people who came up with false accusations that be claimed to be able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">When the high priest demanded for answer from Jesus, he declined and remained silent. The high priest pleaded with him to tell them if he was the Christ, the Son of God. Jesus responded that he had said so and added that he would see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">On hearing that, the high priest tore his robes claiming that Jesus had committed blasphemy and therefore requires no further Witnesses. The people responded in one voice that he deserves death. They spat on his face, struck him and some slapped him and asked him to prophesy to know who struck him.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">At the point of his trial, Peter denied him three times before the cock crow just as Jesus earlier informed him. When the cock crowed at dawn, Peter remembered the words of Jesus. He then went out and wept bitterly.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Jesus before Pilate (Mtt. 27: 11-31; Mk. 23:1-25; Lk. 23: 1-5)&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Jesus was brought before the governor who asked him, &ldquo;Ave you the king of the Jews?&rdquo; Jesus replied &ldquo;You have said so&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">When he was accused by the Chief priests and the elders, he answered nothing. His silence to the charges against him surprised the governor.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">The Jewish laws demands that at the feast the governor would release for the crowd any prisoner of their choice.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Then, there was in custody a notorious prisoner called Barabbas, whom the people demanded the governor to release for them while Jesus should be killed. Pilate know that the people delivered Jesus to him out of envy.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">While he was seated on the throne, his wife sent word to him, asking him to have nothing to do with Jesus, whom she described as a &ldquo;righteous man&rdquo; owing to what she suffered in a dream over Jesus. Following the continued demand for the release of Barabbas and for Jesus to be crucified; he washed his hand before the crowd and declared himself innocent of Jesus blood, having seen that he was losing the confidence of the crowd and to avert possible riot.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">The crowd however accepted the responsibilities of his blood upon themselves and their children.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">The soldiers took him to the praetorium and in the presence of a great battalion stripped him, and put a scarlet robe upon him They also crowned him with thorns and made mockery of him. Thereafter, they put his own clothes on him and led him out to be crucified.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Christ before Herod (Luke 23: 6-12)&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">The account of the trial of Jesus as contained in the Gospel of Luke has it that when Pilate learnt that Jesus was a Galilean and belonged to the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him over to Herod in Jerusalem.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">When Herod saw Jesus, he was happy, for he had for long desired to see Jesus, having heard about him Herod was hoping to see Jesus perform some signs before him. He questioned Jesus at some length, but Jesus did not give him any response.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">The chief priests and the scribes stood by and accused him. Herod and his soldiers treated him with contempt, made mockery of him and-then dressed him in expensive attire before sending him back to Pilate.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">The result of it was that the long outstanding enmity between Herod and Pilate was resolved and they became friends again.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Example<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">After his arrest, Jesus was taken to&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">A.

Fire is a strong detractor. Consider the scripture vividly, the testing of the genuineness of faith is likened to the way the pureness of gold is tested through fire.

As they were going, they saw Simon of Cyrene and compelled him to carry his cross. When they came to Golgotha (the place of a skull), they offered him wine mixed with gall to drink, which he tasted and declined. Luke recorded that a great crowd including women were crying for him. But Jesus turned and said to them, &ldquo;Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and your children.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">After crucifying him, they divided his garments among themselves by casting lots.

If you are the son of God, come down from the cross.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">The chief priests, the scribes and the elders also mocked him saying, &ldquo;He saved others&rsquo; he cannot save himself. He is the king of Israel; let him come down from the cross, and we will believe in him.&rdquo; The robbers who were crucified with him also made mockery of him.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Luke pointed out that one of the robbers asked him whether he was the Christ, which prompted the other to challenge him asking him whether he had no regard for God.

And about the ninth hour Jesus cried in a loud voice, &ldquo;Eli, Eli lama sabachthani?&rdquo; which means, &ldquo;My God my God, why hast thou for sake me?&rdquo; some of those who stood by thought that he was calling Elijah, probably to come and save him. One of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed and then offered him to drink.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Jesus then cried in a loud voice and died. Immediately, the curtain in the temple torn into two, from top to bottom. This was followed by earthquake, splitting of rocks, opening of the graves and raising of the saints who had fallen asleep.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Luke noted that before he died, that he cried out in a loud voice, &ldquo;Father, into thy hands I. commit my spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">When the centurion and those who were with him keeping watch over Jesus saw what happened, they were all filled with awe, and testified, &ldquo;Truly this was the Son of God.&rdquo; The devout women who witnessed his crucifixion were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the two sons of Zebedee.
