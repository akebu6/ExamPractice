  "text": "In this chapter, it is discovered that Salma gives Habib Tomiwa’s mobile line instead, and unknowing to Habib, he calls Tomiwa to go out on a date with him. Tomiwa is curious about Habib and decides to go out on a blind date but eventually discloses the switch in mobile lines. Habib likes her still and shops for her and her roommates. He also gives Tomiwa some money for herself and her roomies. She is elated and her roommates shared in this happiness. At first, Salma agitates against Tomiwa’s approval of Habib and accuses her of being a chameleon. Ada and Ngozi intervene but the issue escalates. They soon come to a state of tranquillity as soon as someone knocks at the door. They do not want to have to share their lots with other neighbours.\n\nMeanwhile, Salma and her roommates continue to excel in their separate departments and prepare for General studies papers."
