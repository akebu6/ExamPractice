[n the creation of man in Genesis 2, the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and upon that man became a living being. Thereafter God planted a garden in Eden, in the east where he put the man he created. God made so many good trees that are good for food to grow and in the midst of the garden was the tree of life and the of the knowledge of good and evil. There was a river that flowed out of Eden to water the garden and there it divided and became four rivers.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">These are Pishon, Gihon, Tigris and Euphrates.

The man gave name to all cattle, birds and to every beast of the field, but no helpmate was found suitable for the man.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">As a result, God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man and while he was asleep, God took one of the man&rsquo;s ribs and enclosed it with flesh. He built the rib into a woman and brought her to the man who exclaimed, &ldquo;This at last is bones and &lsquo;flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken Out of man&rdquo; (Gen. 2; 23), This explains why a man should leave his father and his mother and Cleaves to his wife, and they become one flesh.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">At that point the man and the woman were both naked, and were not ashamed.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">The river that flowed out from Eden to water he garden divided into four rivers as follows:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Example<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">A.

As a result, prophet Daniel pointed out that he will be driven away from the people and made to live with the wild animals, where he will be made to eat grass like an oxen until he acknowledges that the Most High is sovereign and rules over the kingdoms of men.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">He however advised the king to accept his counsel by leaving his sins and practicing righteousness through showing mercy to the oppressed.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Fulfillment of the Dream and the King&rsquo;s Confession<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">At the end of twelve months, while the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, he said, &ldquo;ls not this great Babylon, which I have built with my mighty power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">While the words were still in his mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, &ldquo;O king Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you, and you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; and you shall be made to eat grass like an oxen; and seven times shall pass over you, until you have learned that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will&rdquo; (Daniel 4: 31-32).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Immediately the king was driven from among men and he ate grass like an ox, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles&rsquo; feathers and his nails were like birds&rsquo; claws.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">At last when the king regained his reasoning, he acknowledged the Sovereignty of God and his everlasting dominion. Having realized this, he blessed, praised and honoured God who lives for ever and whose kingdom endures from generation to generation. His confession (Daniel 4:28-37) is that of a man humbled before the source of absolute power and authority.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Example<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Daniel became distinguished above all the other presidents and satraps because he<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">A. was more educated than them<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">B. had a close relationship with the king<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">C. had an excellent spirit<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">D. was a Jew from Judah<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Example<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">How many days did Daniel and the other Jewish servants ask the steward to test them with vegetables?<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">A. 5 days<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">B. 10 days<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">C. 15 days<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">D. 20 days<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">B<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">10 days<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Dan 1:20 And in every matter of wisdom and understanding concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his kingdom.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';\">Dan 1:21 And Daniel continued until the first year of King Cyrus.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<\/body>\r\n\r\n<\/html>",
