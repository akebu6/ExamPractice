   "text": "This chapter reveals the true identity of Mohammed Kabir, a laboratory technologist employed by the University. He has been nicknamed Doctor since secondary school and has always been referred to as Dr. Kabir.\n\nLabaran discovers Salma has been played by the gambler and informs Habib suggesting Zaki be contacted to handle the situation. Honourable Habib is skeptical about involving Zaki owing to his failure in the first mission of abducting Alhaji Adamu’s son. Habib yields to Labaran’s suggestion and contacted Zaki to trail Kabir.\n\nKabir is spotted at a gambling spot. Kabir wins the game at the gambling spot and leaves to avoid losing it all. Sadly, he is trailed by thugs whose mission is to retrieve Kabir’s wins. Zaki catches up with Kabir as he is being attacked by the thugs. Zaki strikes the thugs and gains control of the situation as they flee. He then concentrates on Kabir, collects the money, and left him bruised.\n\nUmmi also tells her children how Salma changed her immoral ways. Salma becomes serious and decent after the death of her father and because of her level of seriousness Ummi allows Salma to become friends with her."
