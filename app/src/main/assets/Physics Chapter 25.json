Anions are formed by gaining electrons while cations are formed by losing electrons. During ion formation in chemical reaction there is no change in the number of protons and neutrons, but an ion is formed when the number of protons is not equal to the number of electrons<\/span><\/p>\r\n \r\n<\/body>\r\n\r\n<\/html>",
