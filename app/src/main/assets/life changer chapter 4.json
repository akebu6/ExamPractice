  "text": "This chapter gives a further account of Salma’s splendour and pomposity. Salma goes to Dr Debo, the level coordinator, to have her forms signed. Unfortunately, Dr. Debo loses touch of his many years of discipline and makes advances towards Salma. Salma arrogantly dismisses his attempt and further insults him before leaving the office. Dabo is left is a state of regret and he remorsefully prays to be vindicated from the impact of what he has created.\n\nSalma completes her hostile registration and moves into a room occupied by three other girls. Initially, Salma does not like the sight of her roomies but eventually, they begin to grow fond of each other and form an intimacy they regard as sisterhood. On a faithful evening, Salma is offered a ride in a Mercedes Benz by two men, Habib and his driver, Labaran. She slides in knowing it is dangerous and she conceitedly plots a scheme to decline Habib’s request to date her if he eventually proposes.\n\nHaving to decline a man that rides Benz is Salma’s way of upgrading her standard and getting recognition and respect from her colleagues and the entire university."
