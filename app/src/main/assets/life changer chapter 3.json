  "text": "Ummi tells the story of ‘the quiet one’, a boy named Talle. Talle is given birth after many years of child futility and his birth causes the death of his mother. He grows up possessing a silent character and becoming even more reticent with the death of his father and stepmother, thus, ‘the quiet one’ was a perfect description.\n\nTalle is considered a good person by the villager and unable to cause harm. However, Talle needed money at a point and confides in Zaki who proposed the idea of abducting a boy and requesting a ransom. The plan is executed by the duo and Talle restrains the boy in his house. Talle goes to the market for his groceries but his usual request for food items is doubled. Soon, the market woman notices a change in his larger request for groceries and reports the issue to the District head\u00AD\u00AD. While Talle is being interrogated by the District head, policemen rampaged the palace and arrest Talle as a suspect for kidnapping and extortion. Talle and Zaki are eventually sentenced to some years of imprisonment."
