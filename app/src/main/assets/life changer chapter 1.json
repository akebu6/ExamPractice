  "text": "A family of six awaits the arrival of Mr. Esquire. While they wait, Bint gives an account of her classroom encounter with her intrusive Social studies teacher, Mallam Salihu, who is known to act as though he knew a bit more about every subject as he will often ask questions outside the subject of discussion. Bint narrates how she genuinely handled a similar occurrence leaving the teacher dumbfounded by the cheering and laugher of other pupils.\n\nUmmi is seamlessly proud of her daughter, particularly, Bint’s intelligent approach to issues and she joins in the discussion right before Omar joyfully announces his admission to study law at the Ahmadu Bello University. As the family gathers to celebrate Omar’s success, Omar boasts of his achievement and takes pride in solely overcoming examination challenges and several other entry procedures while seeking for admission. Ummi recognizes her son’s naivety and tries to enlighten him about the life-changing capability of university admission. Ummi tells her children how her admission changed her."
