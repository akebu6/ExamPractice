  "text": "Salma finds Moral philosophy very difficult. She, however, prepares by practicing past questions and answering them offhand. Unfortunately, Salma is unable to answer any of the questions during the examination as none of the topics for which she spends the whole night preparing had come out. She resolves into indulging in examination malpractice. Kola provides answers to some of the questions in a note as she copies them into her answer booklet. Regrettably, she is caught by a female lecturer.\n\nSalma is compelled to fill out the Examination Malpractice (EMAL) form and she is ushered to the HODâ€™s office. He transfers her case to the Exams and Ethics committee for further processing. Salma and Kola are expelled thereafter."
