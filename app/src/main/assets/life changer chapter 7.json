   "text": "Salma goes to Habib to help her influence the committee by using his position as a politician. Habib offers to involve Dr Debo but due to her past experience with the lecturer, she declines this suggestion and proffers bribing. Habib offers to give Salma some amount of money to bribe the chairman of the Examination and Ethics Committee (EMEC) but in return, she must repay in kind. Salma is reluctant to accept this offer because of her affair with Labaran and she considers it unfair to have an affair with her friendâ€™s man. Salma soon gives in to his request but unluckily she gives the money to Dr. Kabir, who claims to be the chairman of the EMEC. She soon finds out she has been deceived by Dr. Kabir who was neither the chairman nor a member of the Committee. She is demoralized and breaks down."
